# âœ¨ About Me

I'm shady, a kid with a couple programming languages inside his brain. The language that I know the most of is Python, but I also know a bit of JS and Lua. I'm not really active on here much, and if I am, it's normally just to upload an open source project that people can learn from.

I'm currently working on Project Periodic, which is an attempt at archiving every single Fortnite modding project. You can find more info [here.](https://github.com/ProjectPeriodic/info/blob/main/README.md)
