# üíª Currently Working On
- Learning how to navigate Kali üò≠

# üïú Past Projects
- [character.ai API Documentation](https://github.com/u4pak/characterai-api) - The first ever unofficial guide and documentation for the https://character.ai/ API.

###### Had to private this ages ago due to character.ai staff threatening to take legal action, but now there's [plenty of other documentation / projects out there](https://github.com/drizzle-mizzle/CharacterAI-Discord-Bot), so I got kinda cucked :(

- [Exchanger](https://github.com/u4pak/exchanger) - An open-source Fortnite launcher made in C# that allows you to launch any version of Fortnite on official servers with an exchange code.

###### One of my first ever C# projects, and I really liked the way it turned out. Never got around to finishing some of the features though, so might return to developing it in the future.

- [FTI Map Alerter](https://github.com/u4pak/fti-map-alert) - A Discord bot that alerted a channel when the map image on https://fliptheisland.com changed.

###### Very broken with lots of bugs (didn't even work half the time lmao), but it's still a nice archive on my beginning coding experimentations with undoccumented APIs.

- [FTIA](https://github.com/u4pak/ftia) - A giant archive of all the images used on https://fliptheisland.com.

###### Archived cause there's nothing to update in it.

- [Steam+](https://github.com/u4pak/steam-plus) - A Discord bot that allowed you to interact with the Steam API.

###### One of my first ever NodeJS projects that has many bugs and many issues.
