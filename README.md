# âœ¨ About Me

I'm shady, a kid with a couple programming languages inside his brain. The language that I know the most of is Python, but I also know a bit of JS, C++, C#, Lua, C++, and HTML. I'm not really active on here much, and if I am, it's normally just to upload an open source project that people can learn from.

# ðŸ’» Currently Working On
- Learning how to navigate Kali ðŸ˜­

# ðŸ•œ Past Projects
- [character.ai API Documentation](https://github.com/u4pak/characterai-api) - The first ever unofficial guide and documentation for the https://character.ai/ API.

###### Had to private this ages ago due to character.ai staff threatening to take legal action, but now there's [plenty of other documentation / projects out there](https://github.com/drizzle-mizzle/CharacterAI-Discord-Bot), so I got kinda cucked :(

- [FTI Map Alerter](https://github.com/u4pak/fti-map-alert) - A Discord bot that alerted a channel when the map image on https://fliptheisland.com changed.

###### Very broken with lots of bugs (didn't even work half the time lmao), but it's still a nice archive on my beginning coding experimentations with undoccumented APIs.

- [FTIA](https://github.com/u4pak/ftia) - A giant archive of all the images used on https://fliptheisland.com.

###### Archived cause there's nothing to update in it.

- [Steam+](https://github.com/u4pak/steam-plus) - A Discord bot that allowed you to interact with the Steam API.

###### One of my first ever NodeJS projects that has many bugs and many issues.
